make a goose that walks, honks, and poops

## examples of what's previously done
- [video of bird legs mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXXdaqseHis)
	- uses spring
	- uses motors
	- i need to review physics
- [goose marching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPYmE8zgfgQ)

## plan
sensors
- 2 cameras
- feet sensors? -- i don't think this is needed lol
actuators
- electric motors
	- fast & precise
	- heat very fast, need battery
	- types of motors:
		- linear motor:
			- solenoid motor
		- rotational motor:
			- dc motor actuators
				- changing speed
			- servo motor actuators
				- 360 degree rotation but continuous revolution not compulsory
				- control monitor rotation
			- stepper motors
				- repetitive rotation motion
- hydraulic motors
	- slow & unprecise, complex hydraulic system
	- very powerful
- pneumatic motors
	- use compressed air as energy
	- reliable
	- less prone to mechanical failure
	- lightweight & inexpensive
	- less precise
actuator metrics:
- force & torque - strength & power
- speed & response: fast enough
- accuracy & precision: avg precision - not fall
- efficiency (convert energy into motion) - better, the best
- size & weight: light & not too big either
material selection
- metal
	- steel: high strength
	- aluminium: lightweight compared to other metals
	- brass: corrosion resistance
- plastics
	- low friction, self-lubricating
	- wear resistance
	- carbon fiber 
- composites
	- created from 2+ material
- elastometer
	- flexibility, elasticity, absorb shock
mechanical design
- minimize energy loss
- maximize performance
- duty cycle: amount of time work/use time
- maintaining actuator life
	- regular duty cycle
	- recommended voltage
- communication protocol

- honk
- audio output devices
	- speaker for complex sound
		- would be nice
	- buzzer

## future ideas
- make it fly
- make it swim
- take microphone input
