As title indicates, pillars that reflect who I am as a person (values). It varies for everyone, but here's what's unique about me:

1. 🌱 **Learning**. Always grow when you have the opportunity.
2. 💪 **Persistence**. Never give up.
3. ♻️ **Fail Fast**. Faster feedback loop
4. What you do is who you are. Atomic Habits and Existentialism points to this.
5. 🛏️ **Sleep** is important. Don't sacrifice sleep and other healthy habits.
6. 🚫 **No bullshit**. No lying to yourself, and be truthful with every exp. Be genuine when you need help or don't know.
