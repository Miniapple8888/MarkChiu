title: Pillars
---

As title indicates, pillars that reflect who I am as a person (values). It varies for everyone, but here's what's unique about me:

1. Persistence. Never give up.
2. Fail Fast. Do short things and fail fast to learn faster and keep the motivation rolling. (be like a startup, iterate!)
3. What you do is who you are. Atomic Habits and Existentialism points to this.
4. Sleep is important. Don't sacrifice sleep and other healthy habits.
5. No bullshit. No lying to yourself, and be truthful with every exp. Be genuine when you need help or don't know.
