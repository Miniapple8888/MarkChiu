Eyo what's up, my name's Mark and welcome to my Obsidian repo. Will be taking notes for my learning journey ðŸ“–. Quite empty but you can start looking at [[pillars]]

I'm currently interested in entrepreneurship, [[computer vision]] and robotics in particular. Outside of CS, I enjoy cooking, reading, dancing, and gymming.
