notes I take from startup talks I've attended

## serena ge (09/05/2024)
for context, serena's one of the youngest YC batch
1. dig into 🐰 holes
2. there's a lot of B2B
3. ask other investors to give you contact
4. Canadians are more conservative when investing
5. how to seal the 💰 from investors
	6. show momentum (these companies invested, you will have FOMO if you don't invest in it!)
	7. be cracked, show cracked
6. instead of answering "why you should give me money", ask "why I should take your money"
	1. what vision does the company have for you?
7. accelerators care more about founder's bg
	1. initial idea will change a lot
8. high risk, high reward
9. be impatient with your dreams
10. build your own thing -> like making a git pull request to the world! ⭐️

## ryan gariepy (04/06/2024)
clearpath robotics cofounder
1. work with research profs early on
	1. profs were willing to spend money to acquire equipment
	2. they brought it to research conference and spread the word to other researchers
	3. much easier compared to B2B ~ getting a company representative to do the paperwork
2. had the time to find a product market fit because robotics wasn't big back then
3. why clearpath was succeeding: they sold (product validations)
4. IP patent: treat it like taxes, will not make you succeed but you gotta do them early
5. know your target market: warehouse vs factory is not the same
6. don't overprepare, things change quickly oftentimes
7. hire someone in your domain of expertise
	1. i.e. don't hire someone in a domain you don't have any knowledge of
8. how did you find your founder team and maintain it
	1. founding team was made of people from robotics discussing ideas late at night
	2. find people who have same vision/goals - how long do you plan on doing this startup
		1. most of their members didn't have kids
	3. communicate continuously
	4. don't work on everything at the same time. as you progress, some people will get more specialized in certain domains
		1. ryan was specialized in patents
	5. early acquisition can be good even if you don't profit a lot from it
		1. scaling can be painful
		2. if you are a serial entrepreneur
9. how to not get absorbed by big companies
	1. find out what makes you different from big companies
		1. agility -> faster iteration. R&D at big companies are slower
	2. big companies won't invest in an idea unless there is  BIG market for it
	3. go undercover (stealth) so competitors don't know what you're up to
	4. analyze what big companies are overlooking
