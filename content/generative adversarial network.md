2 neural networks:
- generator
	- creates fake data
	- purpose: fool discriminator
- discriminator
	- evaluate authenticity of data, decide fake/real

adversarial training
- trained in alternating fashion
- trained until discriminator cannot distinguish between real/fake

applications:
- image/video generation
- super resolution
- data augmentation
